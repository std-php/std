# AB Standard Library

The ab-std library is normalization of behavior in PHP.  Goals include:

 - High level access to string, array, and other types of value manipulation
and validation. 
 - Normalization of exceptions, warnings, and other behavior.
 - Improved cross-framework workflows and code bridges.

A roadmap will be added soon.

This is the primary `std\` namespace package and contains all simple utilitiy classes under the `std` namespace:

 - `StrUtil`
 - `ArrUtil`
 - `FilterUtil`
 - `NetUtil`
 - `TimeIntervalUtil`

As of August 2019, this represents a tiny fraction of to-be-released code.
Please stand by for further updates.
